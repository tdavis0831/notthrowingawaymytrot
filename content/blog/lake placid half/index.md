**Training**
I have been following the same training plan for all of my races as part of my base building. Mon at the track, tues an easy run, weds rest, stairs or hills depending on how I feel, thurs easy run, fri rest, sat long run, sun stretching with 2-3 days of strength mixed in. 


**Pre-race**
The night before I met my running coach in real life and we all carb loaded at an Italian restaurant. I had eggplant parm and then topped that off with 2 scoops vegan ben and jerry’s ice cream. I was extra carb loaded for this race. Let’s call it that… 
If you have been reading my blogs, you know I started the morning off with a pre race pop tart and liquid IV. I didn’t have time to get coffee as I chose to sleep in for an extra 20 minutes so I was just raw dogging it out there. 30 minutes before the race I had a banana and Squats gave me an air head for some fuel mid race.


**Race**
This was one of the best races that I have ran this year for many reasons. First off, for some reason it went by SO fast. Squats ran with me the whole way and we were able to run with Carrie for the first couple of miles of her marathon. Squats and I laughed so much. We tried new fuels, stopped for the bathroom a few times, and then all of a sudden we were done with the race. 


Lake Placid is known for the last part of the race being uphill. I was pretty nervous about that part of the race but even that went by fast and wasn’t as bad as I anticipated.


Second, the course was absolutely stunning. It was so beautiful with the lake and the mountains and creeks. The air felt so clean. The weather was near perfect. It was just an amazing experience overall and I am for sure planning on going back next year.


Third, this race has awesome aid support. There was plenty of water, Gatorade, gels, fruits, pickle juice and cola. I really appreciated all of the people that made it happen. Also the medals are really cool and since Lake Placid is pretty small, it was really easy to navigate to the start. I don’t think I could recommend this race more! 


**Post-race**
Post race was great. I was still feeling really good. Had a bunch of food after the race including a sandwich from 46, one of my favorites and some gourmet popcorn. Also pop tarts, a protein bar, an apple, and that was all before the car ride home snacks. I was feeling extra hungry this time around but I am trusting my body and listening to these queues, especially post-race. I wish every race was this fun and enjoyable!!
