The past couple of weeks I have been down in the dumps when it comes to running. I have been going through the motions but really lost that spark that I have been feeling for so long about running. I talked to my coach about this and she reassured me something that I was already thinking- running is now just a normal part of my life and so it might not be an exciting shiny thing anymore, I am just a runner. 

This news is so bittersweet to me. Obviously, I am incredibly happy to be a runner, I have literally been working on being a runner for a year now, it’s all I have wanted for the past year. On the other hand, the shininess, the excitement of running being new is gone. I’m a runner just like I’m an employee at my job, it’s just something that I show up for. And just like getting a new job, it’s exciting at first; You learn a lot, you’re getting to know how it all works and what you need to do to be successful. Eventually though, it’s second nature. You know what you need to do to get the job done and you show up even on days you don’t want to.

Carrie in our conversation asked me to think about my “why” for running now. Now that it’s a part of me, it’s important to remember why I am doing it. So I figured I would share my why. 


First and foremost, my health is my why. I have no interest in not being able to take care of myself as I get older. I think so many people stop moving their bodies as they get older and then the aging process is able to progress really quickly. Harvard health did a study (https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/exercise-and-aging-can-you-walk-away-from-father-time) where they talk about this in detail. The TLDR of that article is that when people stop moving, muscle gets lost, and fat gets put on. This leads to an increase of bad cholesterol and blood sugar (diabetes is real y’all). I have no interest in being someone who can’t go get their own groceries or bath themselves and being dependent on medication to be alive. As someone who spent about 19 years of their life incredibly overweight, it would be a lie not to mention that preventing obesity is also a huge player in this. Of course, being overweight doesn’t automatically make someone unhealthy, but I have never heard of it making anyone any healthier. I worked hard for the body that I have, and running has been able to help me maintain that.


Another why for me is that I really like seeing what I am capable of. I would have never imagined that I would be able to run an half marathon at my current PR, I would have NEVER though I would have a 28 and change 5k, I would not in my wildest dreams would have ever imagined that in 2023 I would be running a marathon for no reason other than I want to. I used to have nightmares in high school the entire week leading up to running the mile and now a mile is easy peasy for me. I have already come so far, and running is a really a way for me to keep pushing myself. 


Also, it’s a really awesome way that I am able to connect with squats. I know that there are much easier ways for people to hang out, but being able to go on a run with a friend and talk and just hang out is really such a incredible feeling, ESPECIALLY if you have wanted to do this before and physically could not. We laugh so much and really have so much fun during all of our runs together and on days we aren’t running the event side by side, the preparation leading up to it, matching outfits, carpooling, the wait at the start line- all of it is such a great time. Finding someone who is interested in running or whatever you want to get into is really helpful and a game changer for sure. Running is fun and exciting because I get to talk about it with my best friend and I will always be grateful to Squats for inspiring me to start running. 


I think my last why for now is also that I love seeing what I can do. There were times I have looked at a training run and thought, there’s no way. When I ran up a mountain for the prospect race, I would have never thought it could be done. Last year I would NEVER guessed I could run a half marathon casually, for fun, while talking. Running has made me stronger physically but mentally as well and I am hopeful that I continue to gain mental resilience along the journey. Now when I think about doing a 100 mile race one day, my immediate thought isn’t “no way”, it’s “well, it would be painful but maybe I could do it”.


Those are some of my whys. We are all on our own journeys and it’s important to find these meaningful reasons when the going get tough, when inspiration is lacking, or when you are just in a rut. Waking up to pound the pavement can be tedious when I am not feeling it, but so far I have been able to think about why I do what I do and get through it. I hope you all find your whys in whatever you do and that those reasons inspire you to keep moving forward.
