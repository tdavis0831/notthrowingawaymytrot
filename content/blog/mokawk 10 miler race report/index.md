**Training**
I have been following the same training plan for all of my races as part of my base building. Mon at the track, tues an easy run, weds rest, stairs or hills depending on how I feel, thurs easy run, fri rest, sat long run, sun stretching with 2-3 days of strength mixed in. 

**Pre-race**
Fueled with a pop tart and some liquid IV as part of my pre race routine at this point. I drove myself to the finish because it was a point to point race so Squats and Dr. Pockets drove us to the start line. It was starting to get warm pretty quickly but it felt ok at the start. Started sipping on water a little but could have started earlier looking back on it all. 

**Race**
The race was great. I told Squats about my sub 1:55 goal and not my sub 1:45 goal. She was able to do a great job pacing us the whole time. I was feeling good, we were laughing and had a really good time. I would say about mile 6 I started to really feel the heat. The sun was beating down on us and even though I was staying hydrated it was starting to feel gross. I wish I had a bandana with ice around my neck for the race. It was pretty flat as the bike trail is and overall, I didn’t have any complaints. The only issue we ran into was this woman who was directly behind us wheezing and gasping for air so loudly but refused to pass us. We stopped for a bit to let her go because that was terrible to listen to but other than that it went great. 

**Post-race**
Post race I felt good still. I didn’t puke, which is always great. I was really hot and kind of irritable, but it was all worth it when we got our special medal that connected to the helderberg to Hudson half marathon medal. I realized after that I smashed my previous 10 mile time by 23 minutes and 55 seconds which is still so crazy to me to even think about. Of course, we all went and got brekkie with Sharaon, Gene and Aunt Diane at a diner after and it was exactly what my body needed after that race. I really enjoyed it and would do that race again, but if there was another race that weekend, I wouldn’t mind that either. The course wasn’t particularly pretty or anything, just a nice accessible route in the area.
