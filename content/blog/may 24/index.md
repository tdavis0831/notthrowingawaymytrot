Well, I guess it’s time to let everyone know I am feeling net neutral about running at this point. I have been running very consistently for 11 months now and the overall “excitement” of being a new runner has finally passed. I don’t feel the need to immerse myself in it 100 percent, I stopped reading the books I got, I no longer listen to just running podcasts or only watching running documentaries. I am still happy when I run, I still love running, I am still excited when I hit new accomplishments, but I don’t feel that obsession I was feeling over the past 11 months. I will say I struggle with ADHD and hyper fixating on interests and then tossing them aside is one of my favorites (ask all the embroidery stuff I got over the pandemic and the sketching materials I bought last week). 


I am so incredibly grateful for both my coach and the marathon. I think that without these 2 things, I would not be running anymore or as seriously as I have continued to. First off, having paid accountability really lights a fire under my ass to get my workouts done. Carrie isn’t someone who would call me up to yell at me if I missed a run, but I have someone that I know is checking my workouts and has put time and effort into my training plan. I would never want to disappoint her (even though I don’t think she would be disappointed if I stopped running today, I truly think she just wants me to be happy and healthy). Also, knowing that I must haul my ass 26.2 miles is incredibly motivating even on days where running seems impossible.


This weekend for example, I almost skipped my long run. I didn’t do it as prescribed on Saturday because I was up too late Friday night and my stomach hurt so badly, I didn’t want to push my body after a long day of stomach issues. I knew I would have to make it up on Sunday, but when my alarm went off at 6 am on Sunday, I hit snooze and rolled back over. I am not sure why, but there was a little voice in my head that questioned what I was doing. I asked myself, has the past 11 months been for nothing? Am I willing to let myself start falling off the bandwagon NOW? With only 5 months of training left? I couldn’t let myself start making excuses now. I know missing one run isn’t going to trash almost a year’s worth of work, but I do know myself and I know once I can make an excuse this weekend, I will surely find one for next weekend. I got myself out of bed and honestly ran an easy 13 miles, it went by super-fast, I didn’t find myself feeling bored or frustrated, I just ran and then it was over.


I have a 10 mile race this weekend and for the first time this year I am feeling very neutral about it. I would like to PR from my past 10-mile race, and I’m excited to be around my dear squats and Dr. Pockets, but I am just eh about it. I know once I get our bibs and set out my racing clothes, I will start feeling more excited but for now I know it’s a thing that’s happening and that’s really as excited as I am about it.


I think it’s completely fine for the shimmer of something new and exciting to fade away over time, and I am not saying I love running any less- I just think my fixation has shifted and this is now just a normal part of my life. In some respects when I think about it that way, that is very good. Running just is, it’s just something I do. I don’t think about my runs typically, I don’t try to get out of them. I just know Monday is TMIRCE, Tuesday is a slow run, Wednesday is stairs or hills or rest, Thursday is a slow run, Friday is rest, Saturday is long run and Sunday is stretching and strength is tossed in along the way. I don’t think about it, I just do it. Even as I write this blog post, it’s been over a week since my last one and I’m typing this at almost midnight with no concern.


This might be my new normal and I am completely ok with that, but there are so few things in my life that I continue to do without being 100000 percent excited about it all of the time, so I guess in some sense I am acknowledging that and also admitting some fear that I have along with it. I don’t think that I will stop training at this point, but it’s totally possible that I could. Giving up is something that usually happens along the way at some point, but I don’t want that. I want to keep going. I want to give it my all and I want to complete many marathons in my life. 


Having these races between now and November might have seemed a little overwhelming at first, but I think they have really kept me on track and are part of the reason that I get out of bed on the days that sleeping in sounds so much better. Attainable smaller goals along the road to the much larger umbrella goal seem to be key for me and I am so glad I have them right now.


So, I might not be “looking forward” to my 10 miler this Sunday, but I am so grateful that I have it as part of my training. It encourages me to continue to show up even on days I really don’t want to. When something becomes a habit, it makes sense that it becomes less exciting or thrilling but to keep it a habit I need to keep showing up. I think the next month or two will be finding that balance. I think it has the potential to be hard, but I think I am on my way. Maybe this is what it really means to be a runner…when you just run.
