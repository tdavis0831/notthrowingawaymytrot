**Training**
I have been training with Carrie now for about 9 months. I have been base building and working on running slow and running long for the NYC marathon. Once a week for the past month or so I have been joining TMIRCE on the track to do some speed workouts, but that hasn’t been very consistent with the weather or my travels. I haven’t missed any of the prescribed runs from Carrie in the past few months and the last time I did was in January when I was moving. I have been eating properly and aiming for 150 g of protein but often come in a little bit below that. I have lost about 35 pounds since June 2022 and have really started focusing on training more seriously. 

**Pre-race**
Carb loaded at the Indian buffet which I would probably not doing again but stayed hydrated. I had about a half cup of coffee and one pop tart before getting ready. When we got to the race about 45 mins before start I ate the other pop tart and sipped on water. We didn’t warm up but we should have as it was cold (about35 degrees). Moments before the race I realized my headphones weren’t charged and so I had nothing to distract me. 

**Race**
The race was probably not as fun as I imagine it now. Not having headphones meant I had to do a lot of positive self talk and that was very helpful. I just kept saying to myself, what is going to hurt more, running fast now or coming in at 30:01. I also had a woman that was running basically the same speed as me, anytime I sped up to pass her she also sped up to pass me. It was actually really annoying, but she was a good pacer I suppose. When I could see the finish line I ended up digging deep and sprinting past her and beat her by 20 seconds give or take. 

**Post-race**
I immediately puked up a little post run which I need to talk to my coach about, I think it just means that I gave it my all, but this has happened in most of the races I run- even when I don’t PR. I was elated with my time and had post-race brekkie with Elisa, Sharon and Gene. 10000/10- such a great race and really what I needed for my confidence. I am really making tangible progress!
