**Training**
This run was part of training for me. I was not trying to PR or anything, I just wanted to complete the race and get the medal. My coach told me to use it as my long run for the week and so I did. My training schedule is typically Monday: track, Tues: 3 miles, Weds: rest (sometimes stairs with TMIRCE), Thurs: 4 miles, Friday: Rest, Sat: Long Run, Sunday: Yoga, abs, stretching. 

**Pre-race**
I was in the city for about a week before this race and was already making poor food choices and smoking here and there. I know, I know. Listen, I LOVE smoking and I have stopped the daily smoking I was doing, only here and there. It's not great but this is my biggest vice. I carb loaded with veggie pasta which is now my go to for carb loading and some bread. I got to bed early since I had to get on the ferry and train to get to the race. I was a little anxious about the weather (I was checking every 30 mins ahaha) because it was forecasted for rain, and I have never done a long rain in the run before. I checked in with my coach for some tips, packed some extra socks and a poncho and figured that the rest was out of my hands. 

**Race**
Getting to the race was no issue. It wasn't raining when I left for the ferry, and it still wasn't by the time I got to Central Park. The race was a really good time! It's funny because now that I have some endurance, I can enjoy runs that I am not pushing myself to race. I tried to just look around, take in the crowd, look at the trees, black squirrels, buildings and just enjoy the run. I forgot how hilly the park is and just told myself to take it slow on the hills but just keep moving my legs. It didn't matter if I slowed down, I just didn't want to walk, and I didn't! Overall, I had a really fun time and would do this race again! 

**Post-race**
Grabbed my medal and shiny blanket and got out of dodge! I hate post-race festivities and usually try to get somewhere not crowded (hard to find regardless in NYC). Went home, went to the diner with Danny and smashed an omelet and half a waffle made by the infamous Emil. It was the best waffle I have ever had.
