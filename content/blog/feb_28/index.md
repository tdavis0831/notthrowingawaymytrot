I have heard the saying “if you run, you’re a runner” over and over, but I must admit I have not always bought into this.

First off, I will say, I really don’t care how anyone identifies in any capacity. If you ran once in high school and never again and feel like you’re a runner, good for you. 

For me, being a runner was something that you achieved, that you can be proud of. If I walk my dog, am I a dog walker? If I paint my house, am I a painter? If I went swimming in a lake once, does that make me a swimmer? So why are we so fast to call someone who runs a few times a runner? 

I think part of this sentiment is inclusion, running is a hard action. To continue to run over and over, to show up- who really wants do to this initially? I think by making the term runner inclusive, it helps people not give up on running. But I personally never felt like a runner until last night.

I have previously ran half marathons, and ran pretty consistently and never have I referred to myself as a runner.

In the past 8 months I have logged about 600 miles running give or take, lost 40 pounds, I have run numerous races, I have run in the heat, the cold, on treadmills, on stairs, on hills and on beaches. I have worn out a few pairs of shoes, I have cross trained with the goal of getting stronger for running, I have changed my diet to fuel my runs most effectively, I have stopped smoking, I have joined running groups, I read books about running and listened to podcasts- hell I have this blog. Even as I am writing this for the first time, it’s clear I really have changed my lifestyle a lot to train for the NYC Marathon. 

For me, last night, for the first time, I felt like a runner. I am not sure if it was because I dragged myself out of my warm house to go run around a track with TMIRCE in 32-degree weather in the dark, or if it was my eyes getting watery from the wind as I was going around the track, but the sentiment overwhelmed me. 

So, what changed internally? Maybe it was just me realizing that this hobby has really become a lifestyle for me. Maybe it was just my brain catching up to everything that has happened over the past 8 months (March marks half way through marathon training since I started in July with Carrie, the best coach ever). I am not sure why the wave of emotion that came over me did last night, but I for the first time thought “wow, I really am a runner”. 

This time, in regard to my back and forth with running, it feels different. It feels like running is here to stay and that it is a very important part of my life and my identity. And I guess that’s part of the answer, I personally am at a point where I feel comfortable enough using the word runner to describe myself. And I guess that’s the nice thing about identity, is that other people don’t get to tell us how to identify. And this post isn’t to say the things that I have done are the standard of what makes each person a runner, but more to realize how much work I have put in before I feel comfortable using the word runner to describe myself. 

Lifestyle and personal identity? Maybe that’s it for me.

There is no set speed, distance, item of clothing, weight, or anything else that can define what a runner is. A runner, by definition, is a person who runs, so maybe I really have been a runner all along. Maybe I just needed cold wind whipping in my face to remind me. 

Regardless, I know now for sure that I AM a runner. 

Hi, I’m Tasha, and I am a runner.
