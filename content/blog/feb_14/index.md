description: "The ongoing saga of my love with the treadmill"

Since it's Valentine's day I am just gonna say it, I love the treadmill. It is my favorite way to run. I know this sentiment isn’t shared by most runners but hear me out – temperature controlled, no need to worry about pacing, my gym is downstairs from my apartment so I always have access to a bathroom and water. I don’t have to think about anything really, I can just go downstairs, get on the treadmill, and go.
Most people find it incredibly boring and I do understand that, but all of the other things outweigh the monotony for me, especially in the winter months. This is the first time in my life that I have ran throughout the winter. I usually stop in November, maybe early December if the weather isn’t too bad but it comes to an end until mid-late March. This wasn’t an option this year, so I allowed myself to fall in love with the treadmill and boy did I fall hard.

I am of course longing for sunlight past 4 pm, the warm sun kissing my face, BBQs, beach days and more- but this will inevitably end with me trading the treadmill for the road. This of course makes sense, the NYC marathon isn’t a treadmill event and I need to get used to running hills, pacing myself, planning for hydration, basically everything that I don’t have to worry about when using a treadmill. 

So, my Saturday long runs that are filled with anime will soon be ending. My forgetfulness of a snack or water will start impacting me greatly and I must figure out where to pee on 20 mile runs eventually. 
So since yesterday was warmer than usual for a February day in Troy, NY, I decided to go to the Monday night track workout held by TMIRCE (the most informal running club ever). I love this running club so much. Elisa brought me many years ago and it really does feel like home. No one expects thing from anyone, you can literally come and walk. I was very nervous as I haven’t been focusing on speed nor have I been running outside but I was excited to return to a club that brought me joy.

I was greeted by some old members that remembered me and met some new runners as well and we were off. 90 mins and 4 miles later I did it. In the cold, in the dark, with new people, I did the track workout and I *gasp* LOVED it.

I will not be able to make the workout next week but am planning on going the 27th. Running with people is such a different experience and I haven’t done it since I was running with NY Front Runners in NYC (maybe October was the last run I did with them?). I encourage everyone who wants to stick with running to find a group, or at least a partner. We all know at this point I wouldn’t be here without Elisa and she keeps me so motivated each day.
To anyone in the troy area that wants to come run but isn’t sure, I encourage you to come. Even if you can’t run the full workout or even any of it, you will find yourself surrounded by people encouraging you each lap and inspiring you to be the best runner you can be.

So, as the days become longer and the warmer weather starts creeping in, my miles on the treadmill will eventually come to an end, but TMIRCE reminded me that there is people waiting and running and for the first time all winter, I am excited to join them.
