As of my last long run, I am on the right track to set a PR this Saturday at the Helderberg to Hudson half marathon (I won’t get into details of times and stuff, I will do that is my post-race report). I had a friend over Monday for board game night and we were talking about H2H and I was saying the same thing- that I was on track for a PR and he said “what happens if you don’t PR”. I have been thinking about this a lot. When I answered him, I basically said that I am not even considering that, I have put so much training in during the past 10 months and my slow paces are already faster than my last half marathon pace so I am going to be fine. He asked again, “yeah but what if you have a bad race and you don’t PR?” 


This man is one of my best friends, I know that he wasn’t trying to seed any negativity in my mind, merely making sure that I would be ok on the off chance that I didn’t PR. There are a lot of factors that go into race day- I could wake up and my stomach is off, or it might be too hot for me to PR. I let him know that I have like 6 other half marathons scheduled for the year so even if this one wasn’t a PR, I am sure one of them would be. 


Let me be clear, if I don’t PR on Saturday I think I will be incredibly upset. I know that racing (especially for anyone that isn’t elite or trying to BQ) is meant to be fun. The training so far has been fun, talking to Elisa about this daily for weeks has been fun, I am having fun. But I do have goals and one of them is to PR this race. I started worrying that I am taking my training too seriously and that maybe this is becoming consuming in a negative way, but then I started to really think. I have spent hundreds of hours running hundreds of miles since I started marathon training. I eat differently. I think differently. I have goals that are going to take years to accomplish around running. I am a new person thanks to the past 10 months and it’s ok to feel passionate about something that I have dedicated so much time to. So yes, if I don’t PR, I am going to be upset and disappointed. Will that stop me from getting back on the track on Monday? No. I have another half marathon April 30th and another 5k that I am going to try to PR at again to move up corrals for the NYC marathon. I have so many goals that are pace related and missing some of them might suck and be painful, but ya know what? I know me, and I know that failure will only push me harder for the next race.


I also have been reading a lot about the power of positivity, I know that sounds so cliché, but I am not entertaining any negative thoughts about this race. I have put so much effort into my training, I have skipped less than a handful of training runs, I do strength, and hills, and abs and all the accompanying work to ensure that my running continues to become better- so why would I doubt myself now? I trust the training. I trust my coach. I trust my body. The goals that I have set for myself aren’t unrealistic- I don’t think that I am going to break 2 hours for this half marathon. Do I plan to one day?  Yes. Do I think maybe next year or the year after I will be able to? Absolutely. But for where I am right now, I just want to PR from my 2019 time and based on all the data from my running in the past 10 months, that shouldn’t be an issue even if I don’t push myself too hard. I am going to keep positive and remind myself of all of the hard work that I have done and the limits that I continue to push for myself. I haven’t disappointed myself yet, and I don’t think this Saturday will be the start of that.


Of course, when we are too focused on time, it can be detrimental to our performance. It can increase anxiety and cause our bodies to tense up. It can make us go out to hard too fast and burn out before the halfway point. I would say that isn’t the case here. I am excited and I am going to be checking my pace of course, but in all reality, I know if I run at a conversational pace (which I did last week) I will PR and that is something that I can’t get over. I went from running a half marathon in 2019 where I was mentally and physically past the point of depletion to being able to cover the same distance carrying a conversation with my best friend. I am proud of this journey and I know with all of myself this race WILL be a PR and I am not going to entertain any “what ifs” because I have trained that out of myself. A race that doesn’t go the way I want it to will simply be a learning experience and fuel for the next race.


So here’s to the power of positive thinking, trusting the process and believing in yourself, unabashedly, without any “what ifs” along for the ride.
