I started training for the NYC marathon July 2022, with about 18 months to prepare. It is now March 2023, and I am HALFWAY done with my training. 

Let’s be clear, the real training, the 17, 18, 19 mile runs- those haven’t come yet. I am not half way done milage wise, merely time wise but I really can’t believe it. I can’t believe in 8 months I will be running a marathon- and not just any marathon, a major marathon. 

There are so many things that I feel but truly I don’t know how to articulate them. The moments that I daydream and find myself fantasizing about the race, before falling asleep thinking about being at the start line, mid run pretending that I am on the course now and how that will feel. The anxiety, the excitement, the fear, the concern all of it. Perhaps it has taken over a good chunk of my life and I am ok with that. I haven’t had something that I have felt this excited or proud over in a long time and I am allowing myself to dive into in whatever ways I want.

I have learned so much over these past 8 months, not only about running but about myself. There really is something special about running 12 miles and sitting in your own head, even with music, allow my thoughts to take me wherever they want. I am becoming a better runner and a better person, I think. I would argue that not everyone feels like I am “better” because I have been more selfish, but as someone who experienced a lot of trauma growing up this is the first time I have been selfish outside of my raging alcoholic self during my first 2 years of college. I have a friend named Sara who talks about unapologetically herself and for the first time I really like I understand what that truly means. 

I didn’t think running would help me grow so much as a person, but it has. In regards to my physical self, I am stronger, leaner and have more endurance than I ever have in my entire life and I have a feeling there’s more to come there. Mentally, I have done things I wasn’t sure I could do and have become stronger in that aspect as well. I genuinely now feel like there isn’t anything  that I can’t do if I make a goal with a plan. 

I am looking forward to the next 8 month- setting new distance PRs, hopefully some pace PRs, completing so many half marathons between now and then, meeting new people, seeing new places- all gifts that moving my 2 legs have given me. 

I am not usually someone who puts goals down publicly until I am on the path of completing them, but I figured now is a good as time as any to get them down. Some of these goals I will meet this year (hopefully) and some of them will take years to accomplish (again, hopefully), but doing this holds me accountable and gives me something to reference once I get to the finish line! 
-Complete NYC marathon without feeling TERRIBLE after
-sub 30 5k officially (I have done this once for a virtual run)
-qualify for Boston marathon 
-complete all 6 major marathons (Tokyo, Boston, London, Berlin, Chicago, NYC)
-Complete ultramarathon
-run at least 1 mile in each state
-run in each town in Vermont
-compete in relay run (ex hood to coast/Ragnar)
-become running coach certified (I will never leave Carrie, I just am a whore for certifications)


I think that is most of them for now, I am sure as I keep running my list will keep changing, but now it’s out there in the universe, I guess the only thing I need to do now is keep running! 

Here’s to 8 more months of marathon training and hopefully a lifetime of running!
