**Training**

Training has been going well for the half. I continued to follow the guidelines that Carrie has set out for me. We are still base building for the half marathon, and I am stronger than I have ever been in any training cycle. I have been going to TMIRCE as often as I can, though it’s not as often as I’d like right now with my busy schedule, but I haven’t missed any prescribed runs. The weekend before the race Elisa and I did a 12.5 mile run and it went really well. I was able to talk during the run and complete the whole thing without stopping. I initially tried to get out of the run with Carrie and asked about a taper, but I am glad she stuck to her initial thought process, it really was the confidence boot I needed for this race.

**Pre-race**

2 days before the race I started carb loading. I had an almond croissant on both days because they are my favorite. I think allowing myself to carb load with foods that are special to me helped me mentally in some capacity. I found some comfort in these tasty treats and was thankful that they were going to fuel my runs. I stayed away from dairy and the night before at some pasta fortified with veggies. I don’t usually pick this pasta, but it happened to be the pasta I carb loaded with the night before the 12.5 run when I went to my friend’s house for dinner and it was good. I am a creature of habit, so I have this sneaky feeling this will probably be my carb loading source for my big runs in the foreseeable future. 

Before the run we did a very small shake out (maybe a half mile at the most) and I felt a little tired, I thought maybe I carb loaded too hard and it was making me feel heavy, but upon reflection I think it was just nerves. I had my pop tart breakfast for carbs and a liquid IV before I left the house and sipped on water until the start. I was a little chilly in the morning, but I knew it was going to be a hot one so I was trying to be thankful for the breeze when it was happening. 


**Race**

The race was a little mixed. I initially thought I would try to negative split, but instead, I positive split the entire time. I know that I still need to work on pacing but for my first half marathon since 2019, my splits were not as all over as I thought they would be. The start of the race I went out too fast (classic) because I was caught up in the excitement of it all, but I felt strong. I was enjoying myself and taking it all in and just happy to be running this event that I was looking forward to for so long. The race got hot fast, it was forecast to be 70 and sunny and halfway through I was really feeling the heat. I had water on my back, but the last few water stops I was pouring water on my head because it was just so hot. The sun felt like it was just beating down on me and I tried to stay positive, but at the end it got me. I was hoping to give it a little gas at the end but I knew if I pushed harder with the heat I would throw up so I kept my final miles as steady as possible. This was the first half marathon that I didn’t walk any part of it and I was really proud.


I have been using pop tarts to fuel but this time they got really crumbly and were hard to eat. I know they have little pop tart bites that come in packages, and I think that I have to get some of them for next time to avoid the crumbles. I didn’t fuel too much during the race because it was just annoying trying to get crumbs out of a package, so I need to work on this still (again, I think the pop tart bites will be perfectly fine, will update once I give it a go).
I also stopped looking at my pace around mile 8 or 9. I was really focusing on my splits and I decided I wanted to focus on having fun. When I was half through, I realized I was going to PR, so I wanted to just be in the moment of the run and I am really glad that I did. 


When I got to just before finish line and saw all of my Elisa, Matt, Sharon, and Gene I was so happy, I felt this sense of love that even as I am writing it I’m tearing up, then I turned to the finish line and Danny, Meg and Kolby were there, I was just overwhelmed. I was smiling ear to ear and those moments made the whole race worth it. I crossed at 2:22:05 with a Net time of 2:21:26- a 27 min and 3 second PR off my half marathon from 2019. 

Even though it was hot and my fueling didn't go as planned, everything else went really great. 

**Post-race**

After the run, I was tired but nothing like after the race in 2019. I was able to walk to the car without any issues and called my coach moments after the race to let her know how I did. I was really emotional and excited and happy- it felt like everything that I have been working so hard for paid off. We all went to the Indian buffet after (except Meg and Kolby) and just got to talk about how great we all did. Matt had an awesome time per usual and Elisa got sub 2 hours. 100000/10 – I had so much fun and I can’t wait for next year to hopefully snag another PR!
