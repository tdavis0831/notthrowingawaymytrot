If I have to read one more post on reddit or listen to another podcast of people saying that running on the treadmill is “less than” running outside in any capacity, I am going to scream, so let’s talk about it.

First off, I fully understand that by running on a treadmill you are not getting hills, wind resistance, and the ability to hold your head proud as people walking and driving by think “wow, that person is super fit and awesome look at them go, what an inspiration to everyone”, but hear me out.

As someone who lives in a place where winters are cold and snowy, there is nothing inside of me that wanted to run outside basically starting in late November, early December. I don’t like the cold, I don’t like the snow, so why would I go run (which is already an incredibly hard task) in an atmosphere I don’t enjoy being in? I still wake up early and get my miles in, they are just on the trusty treadmill. Now, if you are someone that enjoys cold winter running, this post isn’t for you. This isn’t a statement to ditch winter running if you enjoy it, but more of a comfort for those of us who would absolutely rather not. 

And sure, if you are planning on running in an outdoor event in the winter, it would make sense you would be training outside. You would want to be familiar with any possible conditions that might popup during your event, but if you are someone like me who will never (again) sign up for a winter race, then who cares? If you event is in early spring, I would say to try to get some outside time when the snow starts melting on those nice days that peek through every now and again between winter and real spring, but again, if you aren’t racing in the cold, why should you have to endure it? 

I have done at least 95 percent of my winter running on a treadmill at this point. On some decent days I have snuck a run in outside and have joined TMIRCE a few times on the track, but if it is too cold outside, I do not push myself. My goal runs align with the spring, summer and fall- in my instance I still needed to train during the winter but the treadmill is where that happened. 

Here’s the thing, most people who are starting out running don’t particularly LOVE it. It doesn’t feel good, it’s hard, it’s time consuming. I have read through many reddit posts with people talking about their journey and very few of them start out like “the first step I took running I knew it was the love of my life”, many posts start out with “Running was really hard at the beginning” or people who have run then stopped then picked it back up again. So if running is an activity that isn’t super fun to begin with and then you try to shame people into doing it in a climate they aren’t comfortable in, you’re setting them up for failure. This has been the first winter that I have ran consistently and stuck to my training and part of that I believe has to do with the fact that I never made myself feel bad about running on a treadmill.

My coach at the beginning of winter encouraged me to do as many runs outside as I could and I basically told her I would try but that it probably wasn’t going to happen to much. She never pushed me, she never made me feel bad about running my 14 miles indoors, she let me train the way I needed to during the winter and now that spring and summer are around the corner I will begin to transition off the treadmill and on to the road. Easy peasy. I logged ALL of my winter miles, never had to deal with snot freezing on my face or falling on ice- really just an ideal winter if you ask me.

There are many of pros of running on a treadmill in my opinion, such as direct access to water, a bathroom and the ability to watch TV when on a treadmill. I also don’t have to worry about holding my fuel or hydration because I can sit it on the treadmill. I know that I am in the minority, but I really am someone who loves (dare I say prefers) treadmills and I don’t understand the need to make anyone question the miles they logged. 

Actually, many people find the treadmill incredibly boring and can’t believe that I don’t mind logging a few hours on it. To most people stay in the same spot is terrible and not something that they would want to do. I guess for me, monotony beats the cold any time and I am not someone who would slander these beautiful pieces of workout equipment my calling them “dreadmills”. In fact, I’d call it my “steadmill” because I really have come to felt at home on this silly like thing (wow what a reach, what a sad, sad not funny pun).

Outdoor running doesn’t make you more or less badass than someone who is logging indoor miles. Perhaps you don’t understand it, but without the treadmill I would not have continued base building and I wouldn’t be able to make the progress that I have so far – and I know I am not the only runner in this position.

So, let’s cut the treadmill slander once and for all and let people enjoy the things that they choose.
