If you are someone who is or has trained for a half marathon or a full marathon, I am sure you have heard it before, “you must be able to eat whatever you want”.  sigh


Let’s talk about it.


If you leave here with nothing else, please remember you cannot outrun an unhealthy diet. If I was able to eat “whatever” I wanted, like REALLY wanted, I would be loading myself up with cheesecake, even more Indian food than I already get, and Frappuccinos. All of my favorite, like for real favorite, like not vegetables favorite, foods are INCREDIBLY unhealthy. Most of them have a high amount of saturated fat, calories and don’t provide the clean fuel I want in my body right now. So, even though I am working out more than I ever have, if I were to be replacing calories and overall nutrition with food that isn’t adding to my fueling in a positive manner, it could have some serious negative impacts. Runners are not immune to weight gain, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and more.


I also think that many, not all (and I am not throwing shade at anyone’s diet at all) runners tend to want to fuel their bodies with whole foods and foods that increase their physical performance. I find that when people are spending hours and hours a week running, often they have some type of goal or training plan they are working towards. From what I have noticed of running so far, the more whole foods I eat, the better my performance and attitude about running really making those goals easier to attain. 


Am I saying runners need to restrict? No, I am not saying that. What I am saying is that though runners may be burning more calories because of the miles they are logging doesn’t mean binging on unhealthy processed food is the right move either. 


I have found that many runners have a good balance of eating whole foods and food that are less whole-not being afraid to go out to eat, enjoying carbs. I think eventually everyone who sticks with running long enough realizes that if you want to perform well in running, you need something to keep the fire fueled Nutrition becomes less about being afraid of foods society has told us to fear (BANANAS AREN’T THE ENEMY) to eating a well rounded diet. 


So here’s to balance, long lives, low blood pressure and PRs!
