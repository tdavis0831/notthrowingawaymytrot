title: If It's All Mental, Then You Do It

I was having a conversation with my dear Squatty over the weekend and we were talking about when non-runners specifically tell runners that the marathon is mostly mental- so let’s talk about it.

First off, generally speaking, people who are doing a task that takes a lot of effort generally don’t like it when people who have never been through the same experiences try to tell them what is and is not in that area. I know this is a huge leap, but imagine telling someone in medical school, “it’s mostly mental”. They are going to either make you explain more until you yourself realize you have no idea what you are talking about or just smile and nod because they have already made the assumption that you are an asshole (sorry it’s the truth).

Getting into med school requires good grades, a hearty social resume, tests, applications – so much more than just putting your mind to something and then automatically accomplishing it (ask the many people who don’t get into med school if it’s all mental).

In some aspect, reaching a goal does require a lot of mental fortitude. The idea that someone would decide to run 26.2 miles means that they are going to have to use their mind in ways that they probably have never done before. Waking up to run long runs, pushing through pain, learning about the sport, nutrition, gear and so much more- all incredibly mental things. But most people (and I mean 99.9999999) percent of people can’t just show up to a marathon start line and mentally tell themselves they are going to run it all and then do just that. It does take a lot of physical labor to push your body through hours of running, no matter what your mind says.

Here is where I see the grey area, in order to do the physical work, I had to use my mental strength to do so. I had to push down any doubts I have about myself, any fears about failure, push through the pain of long runs, and make sure that I was showing up to complete my training. All of those things surely are mental, but the physical work is just as important. I mentally tell myself, “one day I am going to qualify for the Boston Marathon” and that’s a great goal to have, but guess what- now it means I have to do the work. When I’m doing strength training and lunges are killing me, this is when the mental part kicks in. I remind myself that in order to achieve my goals I need to go through some pain now, I have to push and I have to get stronger.

As I go through my training, it seems as if my body gets stronger, so does my mind. When I reach new speed PRs, distance PRs, push through a track workout I thought would kill me, lose a couple more pound- my mind is assured that everything that I have thought about my strength is true, so why not push a little harder and reach some tougher goals. 

Mental strength I am learning is just as important as physical strength when it comes to endurance sports. During the marathon there are going to be 26.2 miles where I can stop at any point, but I know my mind has to keep my body in the game- but without a strong body my perceived effort would be too high and no matter how strong you are mentally, eventually your legs would stop at that point. Being able to find a balance of mental strength and physical strength is key. 

And sure, there are times where I am telling myself just keep pushing, just a couple more feet, and do the runners math we all love (10 miles is only 2 five miler and 4 2.5 miles which is less than 4 5ks so that’s easy) but to disregard the physical aspect of training is asinine and offensive. The miles I have logged, the races I have run, the sweat I have dripped -all of those things matter 100 percent.

So PLEASE stop telling people it’s all mental – especially if you have never completed or attempted to complete a similar task. You will be doing the whole world a favor.
