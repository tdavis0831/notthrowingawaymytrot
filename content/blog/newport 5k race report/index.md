**Training**
This run was part of training for me BUT I was hoping to move corrals with a pace of around 9-9:30 for each mile. I was trying to go sub 30 for a corral change for the marathon. At this point I was 2 weeks in the city, eating like a trash panda, smoking like a chimney, just being a real asshole for someone who was thinking they were going to have a good run. I did all my training runs still but it wasn't good. I also forgot to mention in my Shape race report that I did pass out a few days before that in the subway terminal. I think I was low sodium; Danny thinks I got food poisoning. I am not going to use that as an excuse for anything, but it is something that did happen and I am noting that. I also went to 2 concerts, so I was up late, traveling, screaming, continuing to eat like an asshole etc. I don't know what I thought was gonna happen for this race. Fueled with an eggplant parm sub before the race- terrible idea. 

**Pre-race**
I had never taken public transportation to Jersey so I left early from my apartment. I had no issues with getting there and the ride was smooth. When I got to the hotel where I was meeting Squats and Dr. Pockets I was shitting my brains out, 100 percent from my poor dietary choices. We did a shakeout mile and took some pictures and that was a good time and filled me with false hope.

**Race**
 I started the race and was doing ok, a lot of weaving through slower people but I was doing ok. After a mile my lungs hurt and mentally, I was just defeated. I let myself walk, I was texting people how terrible I was doing, I cried, I ran again slower, stopped again, cried some more. It was the worst race I have ever ran. I eventually was able to get myself to at least jog the remainder of the race, so I didn't DNF (I was very close to just walking off the course). Terrible. Just terrible. The smoke really got to my lungs, and I mentally was in a really low place. I finished which is something but boy did that not go the way I was hoping.

**Post-race**
Showered. Was moody and upset. Got on and off the wrong trains like 3 times. I was just over it. I was meeting my mom in the city to see Wicked and spend the day together and I was pissy for the first hour or so. She reminded me I have always been competitive and not to let it get to me too much. After some food I was fine and ready to move on. Turns out that it was my best pace for NYRR and I regret walking and not just slowing down my run. Many, MANY lessons learned and it's time to move on and start prepping for the next one.
