The new years is always this symbolic representation of change. People feel as if they need a new calendar year to make the start of their “new year new me”. Statistically speaking, less than half of people fulfil their new years goals with the vast majority of not keeping up with it within 3 months. 
I started my marathon journey in July of 2022, maybe that’s why I have been able to stick with it. There was no pressure of television commercials of society expecting me to do something. I just had a goal I wanted to reach and decided to do something about it.

But I do relish in the sentiment “new me”, because I am absolutely a different person since marathon training. I have made myself my number one priority, something that I haven’t done every before in my life. I stopped smoking, I don’t drink, if plans interfere with my running schedule I do not commit to them. I spend the money that I work hard for on things that bring me real life joy. I am no longer going to events because I feel like I will let people down by not going. 

Marathon training has taught me boundaries. Right now I am still very uncomfortable saying no to people, but hopefully that feeling will go away soon. I don’t make as much time for people as I would have before because right now for me, having my person space and time is the thing I need the most. Can you believe running has taught me this life lesson? 
Right now we (me, Elisa and Matt) have 4 half marathons scheduled between now and the full marathon with a 10 miler thrown in there somewhere. I am sure that this list will grow as I am starting to get more and more excited about races as I become a better runner.

There are so many more miles that I have to run this year before getting to the NYC marathon and I am trying not to wish them away, eager for November 5th. But, each day, my focus is the marathon. When I eat food, when I run my runs, when I do strength training, each time I ask myself “Am I doing exactly what I need to do to make sure that when I am standing on the start line I know I prepared as best as I could?”

Sometimes the answer to this is no, but 90 percent of the time I would say the answer is absolutely yes. So for now, I keep doing what works. Even if that means people think that I am crazy, or selfish, or anything in between. We have one life to live and I am finally ready to stop living for other people.
